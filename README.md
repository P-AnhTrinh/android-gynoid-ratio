# android-gynoid-ratio

### ðŸ”¬ Objectives

1. Investigate the relationship between the android/gynoid ratio and cardiometabolic measures in youth
2. Determine whether the android/gynoid ratio outperforms conventional adiposity measures (waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR)) in predicting health outcomes.  

### ðŸ”¬ Methods

Participants were from the QUÃ©bec Adipose and Lifestyle InvesTigation in Youth cohort (n=625, baseline mean<sub>age</sub>: 9.6Â±0.9, mean<sub>zBMI</sub>: 1.081Â±1.380.3, 54% male). 

At baseline and 2-years follow-up, fasting lipids, plasma glucose, and insulin were analyzed. 

Android/gynoid ratio was based on dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. 

The association between the adiposity measures and biochemical outcomes were analyzed using multiple linear regression, adjusted for pubertal status and age. Estimates were standardized and sex-stratified. 

### ðŸ”¬ Results

At baseline, the android/gynoid ratio was significantly associated with TC, HDL, and LDL (girls: Î²=0.09 mmol/L, Î²=-0.09 mmol/L, Î²= 0.11 mmol/L, respectively, p<0.05; boys: Î²=0.16 mmol/L, Î²=-0.08mmol/L, Î²=0.16mmol/L, respectively, p<0.05).

Results were similar at follow-up. WHR was associated with fasting lipids (p<0.05) and insulin (p<0.05), but WHtR and WC were not associated. The android/gynoid ratio significantly outperformed the other measures.
